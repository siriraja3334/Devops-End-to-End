################ Docker Commands #################
docker images --> This command is used to list all the Docker images.

docker ps ------> This command is used to list all the running Docker containers.

docker ps -a ---> This command is used to know the details of all the running, stopped, or exited containers.

docker pull <image-name> -----> This command is used to download a Docker image from a registry.

docker build -t <image-name> -> This command is used to create a build Docker Image.

docker run <image-name/id> ---> This command is used to start a new Docker container from an image.

docker run -d <image-name> ---> This command is used to run the container in the background instead,[detach].

docker stop <container-id> ---> This command is used to stop a running container.

docker run -d -p 8080:80 <image-name> ---> To mapping port numbers from docker containers.
["The syntax is as follows: -p host_port:container_port .
@For example, to map port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container, you can use -p 8080:80".] 

docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx -> This command is used to default NGINX configuration.

docker rmi <image-name> ------> This command is used to remove a Docker image.

docker rm <container-id> -----> This command is used to remove a Docker container.

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) -> This command is ued to remove the all stopped containers are deleted.



########### Dockerfiles ############
FROM ---> To pull the base image(docker-hub).

RUN ----> To execute linux commands.

ADD & COPY ----> To copy a directory from local machine to the docker container.

CMD ----> It can be used for executing a specific command within the conatiner. 

ENTRYPOINT ----> It sets a default application to be used every time a container is created with the image.

WORKDIR -------> It sets the path of working directory.

ENV ----> It sets a environment variables.

EXPOSE -> It associates a specific port to enable networking between container and to the outside.....

MAINTAINER ----> It defines a full name and email address of the image creator.

USER ---> It sets the USERNAME which is to run the container.

VOLUME -> It is used to enable access from container to a directory on the host machine.

LABEL --> It allows to add a label to your docker image.




### What is Docker?
Ans.Docker is a open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications quickly within lightweight containers.

### What is a Docker container?
Ans.Docker container is a lightweight, executable package that contains everything needed to run an application.
    Docker containers are based on Docker Image & use Docker Engine to run the applications in isolated environments.

### What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?
Ans.Docker containers share the host OS kernel and are more lightweight.
    VM's are include a full of OS and more require resources to run.

### What is a Docker image?
Ans.A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers.
     It contains the application code, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files necessary for the application to run.

### How do you create a Docker image?
Ans.A Docker image is created using a Dockerfile, which contains a series of instructions to set up the environment.
    The command [docker build -t <image-name> .] is used to build an Docker image from the Dockerfile.

### What is a Dockerfile?
Ans.A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to build a Docker image.
     It specifies the base image, adds files, installs dependencies, and configures the environment.

### What is Docker Hub and how is it used? 
Ans.Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows users to store, share, and distribute Docker images.
     It provides a central repository for both public and private images, making it easy to access and manage containerized applications.

### What are Docker volumes?
Ans.Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
    Volumes are stored outside of the container filesystem.

### Where is the default Docker Volumes are stroed?
Ans.Volumes are stored in location [“/var/lib/docker/volume”].

### How do you create a Docker volume?
Ans.We can create a Docker volume using the command [docker volume create <docker-volume>].

### What is the purpose of Docker-compose tool?
Ans.Docker compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker appllicatons using a YAML file.

### What is Docker swarm?
Ans.Docker swarm is a native clustering tool for Docker that allows we can manage a cluster of Docker engines.

### What is Docker network?
Ans.Docker network allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host.

### How do you create a custom Docker network?
Ans.We can create a custom Docker network using the command [docker network create <docker-network].

### What are the different types of networks?
Ans.The main types are bridge,host,overlay and macvlan networks.

### What is the role of a Docker Registry?
Ans.A Docker registry is a stroage and distributaion system for Docker images.
